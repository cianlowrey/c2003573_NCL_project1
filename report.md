I have actively used python before in both my GCSE and A-Level studies, although I used C# and javascript more towards the end of my studies. 
I've also not worked with code for over 2 years due to personal circumstances post A-Level, so it was a lot of relearning.
It was the main language I was taught in, however the project still introduced new aspects of the coding process to me.
Panda3D was a new environment to learn and understand. 
Fortunately it seemed to be fairly easy to understand with the language they use, as the set terminology directly says what the function does.
Such as pandaActor and scene clearly being the panda and environment, and setScale being used to give the relative size of each subject.
I did to some degree struggle with certain aspects of the process however, where I encountered error messages despite following along with the project.
It required a lot of rereading and going over previous steps, but certain errors I just could not overcome, so I resorted back to the version where the code worked, and worked from there again to make my additions.
Particularly, a lot of the directories that the project stated 'I should already have' weren't present with my files, which meant I had to make them myself.
This caused a big headache as I had to ensure files were in the correct directories and folders.
It was also this issue that caused parts of my code to break, and became unsolvable no matter how much time I put into fixing it.
It claimed that I did not have a 'walking_panda' package, which the project timeline said I was supposed to have. 
It through me into a turmoil of adding packages, renaming code, and frantically checking every line of code until it worked, and yet nothing I did seemed to have any effect.
Although I kept the module code in my submission, the 'walking = MyApp()' code still appears at the end of panda.py, just so I had a working piece of code.

For future pieces of work, my focus will be improving my ability to use modules and get them working accordingly. 
This will help clean the code up and separate it so that it becomes easier to read and understand by others.
Also when it came to committing messages, I attempted to commit at every change of the code, but I feel I have missed a couple of commits throughout, so improving my consistency with that is vital.
I need to improve my time management as well for the next project, as I feel I didn't optimise my time to its fullest to gain the most out of the project as desired. 
Although this did come due to some personal issues over the last few weeks that I've been dealing with alongside studying.
These future changes to my approach are simply issues that come with time and practice using these new tools.
